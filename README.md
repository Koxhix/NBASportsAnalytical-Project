# NBASportsAnalytical-Project
This will be Sports Analytics project comparing the careers of LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry using real NBA data. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and performance visualizations in Tableau and Google Colab.
I was able to learn a lot though this project on how to clean data and organize data.
I hope you enjoy
